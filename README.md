# Functionality

This project renders a set of player data from the provided json file. It renders it in a table format and allows the user to filter by player name through the top search bar. You can also sort by some of the columns by clicking on the individual headers. The user can also download the data in a CSV format by clicking the download button. This will download the current data that is displayed to the user, so if the data is sorted and filtered that subset of data will be downloaded.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.1.2.
